# ExpenSys

ExpenSys is an efficient expense tracking application designed to help you manage your finances and maintain a detailed record of your expenses. Whether you are an individual looking to budget your personal finances or a business owner tracking expenses, ExpenSys streamlines the process for you.

## Intuition
I found it challenging to track my daily expenses using traditional methods such as Google Spreadsheets or existing expense management apps. They often lacked the flexibility and data organization I needed. As a result, I decided to develop ExpenSys to address these issues and create a more user-friendly expense tracking solution. Please feel free to submit feature requests or pull requests; I'm open to accommodating them in future releases.

## Key Features

### Expense Logging
- Users can easily log their daily expenses into the system, providing a detailed record of their spending.

### Monthly Reports
- Generate monthly reports based on your spending, allowing you to track your financial habits over time.

### Categorization
- Expenses are categorized into main categories, including "Essential," "Expense," and "Loss of Money." Users can also view monthly reports based on these categories.

### Subcategories
- Subcategories provide more granularity, such as "Groceries," "Vegetables & Fruits," "Outside Food," "Salon," "Transport," "Medical," "Shopping," and "Loss of Money." These subcategories are displayed alongside their respective main categories.

### User-Specific Reports

### User-Centric View
